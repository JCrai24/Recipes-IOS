### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

    I chose to prioritize code structure and maintainability without too much additional fluff -> 
    I value performance as long as issues are mimimal and easy to fix. I also focused on applying the
    downloading and caching of images without affecting the performance of the UI. 
    

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

    I spent 5-6 hours on this project.
    
    1.5 hour - drawing up a plan deviding the project into core and additional features,
               seperating concerns and creating a list of errors and test cases for each
               feature/concern. Creating code structure
    
    1 hour - studying filemanager usage and in-memory caching as well improving my 
             knowledge of different kinds of ascynhronous processes. 
    
    1 hours - implementing fetching of recipe data and decoding, handling errors appropriately. 
    
    1.5 hours - Implementing caching, running test cases on caching. Improving error handling 
                in caching process for both fetching and saving images.
    
    1 hour - Building out the UI and adding search feature
    
    

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

    I focused on the core use case without creating many extra features. I kept the UI simple
    and focused on minimizing errors and trying to make the loading of the recipes as clean 
    and smooth as possible.
    
    Using the file-manager for both large and small images could potentially lead to bulky storage,
    but is effective in improving performance in the short term. 
    
    
    
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
    
    Minimal UI and lack of additional features. 
    I am not an expert in writing unit tests. 
    Search feature does not handle clearing of filter without complete reload.
    
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

    I have a lot going on at the moment and was not able to start this until today. I hope I am not too late.
